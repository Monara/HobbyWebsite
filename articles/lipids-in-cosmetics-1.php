<p>One of the goals I had in mind before making this website was not to just plainly whip out a bunch of similar-looking formulas regularly: 
surely, readers will come back more, but does anyone truly learn anything just by simply repeating? 
I wanted to synthesize knowledge in some way that would help me (and hopefully a few others) to become a better formulator. 
So here comes the first general guide to formulation decisions, encompassing a few facts, some experience, and musings. 
<br><br>The feeling of being overwhelmed whenever you are choosing lipids for the oil phase of a cream or lip balms should be familiar to many. 
I had not heard of babassu oil for example before I got into formulating. 
There's dozens of vegetable oils, and what about all the other available lipids like esters?..
<br><br><b>What's in a vegetable oil?</b>
<br><br>Let's start simple, with familiar vegetable oils. 
How much variety is there actually? Is that rare raspberry seed oil does anything special that, say, cheap sunflower won't? 
For that we need to consider the constituents of oils.
<br><br>All oils are made up of fatty acids that are classified as saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, 
and fit the categories of short / medium / long/ very long chain fatty acids depending on the amount of carbon.
<br><br>Look at the structure of lauric fatty acid, which makes up to 50% of coconut oil <a href="https://acmechem.com/lauric-acid-98/">[acmechem.com]</a>: 

<br><br><img src="/img/postimg/lauric_acid1.png" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='/img/default.jpg'" style="width:60%" alt="Lauric fatty acid">
					
<br><br>Or a simplified structural image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauric_acid">[Wikipedia]</a>:

<br><br><img src="/img/postimg/lauric_acid2.png" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='/img/default.jpg'" style="width:70%" alt="Lauric fatty acid">					
					
<br><br>Lauric acid is considered a medium chain fatty acid as it includes 12 carbon atoms (within the range of 6 to 12). 
It is considered a saturated fatty acid as all the bonds between the carbon atoms are single, which makes it less reactive. 
It has a linear structure. As a shorthand, it is referred to as C12:0 (carbon atoms: double bonds). 
<br><br>Now consider oleic fatty acid structure, which is the main constituent of olive oil [<a href="https://healthjade.net/oleic-acid/">healthjade.net</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleic_acid">Wikipedia</a>]:

<br><br><img src="/img/postimg/oleic_acid1.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='/img/default.jpg'" style="width:70%" alt="Oleic fatty acid">
<br><br><img src="/img/postimg/oleic_acid2.png" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='/img/default.jpg'" style="width:70%" alt="Oleic fatty acid">
					   
<br><br>Oleic acid fits the range of 13 to 21 carbon atoms, making it a long chain fatty acid. 
It has 18 carbon atoms and one double bond (C18:1). 
Since there's only one bond like that, it is called a monounsaturated fatty acid (with more double bonds it would be called a polyunsaturated fatty acid). 
Having a double bond means that it could potentially react with a couple of hydrogen atoms, breaking the double bond into two single ones.
<br><br>Think about soybean oil and soy wax, also known as hydrogenated soybean oil. 
We start with soybean oil that is liquid at room temperature: 
it mostly (around 60%) consists of polyunsaturated fatty acids. 
With the help of a catalyst, hydrogen gas is introduced and many double bonds lost, making the oil much more solid.
<br><br>Notice the different shapes of these fatty acids, which tells about their state. 
Linearly-structured lauric acid can stack more closely together than the irregularly shaped oleic acid: 
thus one is more likely to be have a higher melting point than the other and remain solid at room temperature.
<br><br>The melting point also depends on the chain length. You probably know that coconut oil melts at lower temperatures than cocoa butter. 
We know that coconut oil is up to 50% C12:0 lauric acid, and cocoa butter can be around 25% C16:0 palmitic and 35% C18:0 stearic acid. 
Longer chain, higher melting point!
<br><br>There are a lot of different fatty acids that make up oils in different proportions. Let's analyze an oil profile (data taken from Wikipedia):

<br><br><img src="/img/postimg/pie_chart1.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='/img/default.jpg'" style="width:100%" alt="Oil A">

<br><br>You'll recognize oleic acid as the main constituent. It is followed by a polyunsaturated fatty acid as denoted by the number 2. 
There's some saturated fatty acids. We can safely assume this oil is liquid at room temperature. 
"Other" is made up phenols, carotenes, squalene, and tocopherols in small amounts.
<br><br>Now let's look at a similar profile with its main constituents:

<br><br><img src="/img/postimg/pie_chart2.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='/img/default.jpg'" style="width:100%" alt="Oil B">

<br><br>It has even less of saturated fatty acids, thus definitely liquid.
<br><br>These oils are not dissimilar in structure, right? But oil A is the fancy argan that is supposed to be magical for hair, and oil B is the cheap common rapeseed that I buy for cooking by the litre.
<br><br>But let's revisit one of the key points: that double bonds can be broken. 
<br><br><b>Rancidity</b>
<br><br>Have you noticed that many oils are sold in dark glass bottles and are recommended to be kept in the fridge? This relates to delaying rancidity. There are many factors contributing to rancidity, such as higher temperatures, light, oxygen, moisture, heavy metal traces, and simply time. There’s a few mechanisms for rancidity, but most commonly discussed one being oxidation. As oils start to break down, the flavour and smell (remember the smell of old oil crayons?) change. Since saturated fatty acids are the least reactive, oils containing them oxidize more slowly; polyunsaturated fatty acids are the most vulnerable.  For a more detailed reading on oils and oxidation, see <a href="https://www.oilsfats.org.nz/documents/Oxidation%20101.pdf">this</a>.
<br><br>To formulate stable and longer-lasting products, we need to know which oils are least likely to go rancid quickly. Luckily, there's no need to look at all individual oil profiles as that information can be quickly gleaned from an <b>iodine value</b> of an oil.
<br><br><b>Iodine value</b>
<br><br>Iodine value of an oil shows how much of iodine it can combine with per 100 grams of oil: fewer double bonds – less iodine. It is a good indicator of possible rancidity issues.
<br><br>Here's a list of common oils from least to most reactive, on average [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_value">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.dgfett.de/material/physikalische_eigenschaften.pdf">dgfett.de</a>]:

<br><br>Soft and brittle oils
<br><br>Coconut oil 6-11
<br>Babassu oil 10-18
<br>Palm kernel oil 14-21
<br>Cocoa butter 32-40
<br>Mango butter 46
<br>Palm oil 49-55
<br>Shea butter 52-66
<br>Illipe butter 58-65

<br><br>Liquid oils
<br><br>IV < 100
<br>Avocado 63-95
<br>Macadamia 75
<br>Olive oil 75-94
<br>Jojoba oil 80-85
<br>Castor oil 81-91
<br>Hazelnut oil 83-90
<br>Peanut oil 82-107
<br>Argan oil 92-102
<br>Almond oil 92-106
<br>Meadownfoam oil 95

<br><br>100 < IV > 125: use with care
<br>Apricot kernel oil 97-110
<br>Rice bran oil 99-108
<br>Rapeseed oil 94-120
<br>Sesame oil 100-120
<br>Pumpkin seed oil 117
<br>Corn oil 107-128
<br>Wheat germ oil 115-128

<br><br>IV > 125: not recommended
<br>Grapeseed oil 94-157
<br>Sunflower oil 110-145
<br>Soybean oil 120-139
<br>Camelina oil 127-155
<br>Safflower oil 135-150
<br>Walnut oil 132-162<
<br>Borage oil 147

<br><br>IV > 150: not worth it 
<br>Evening primrose oil 152
<br>Hemp oil 150-167
<br>Blackcurrant oil 173-182
<br>Flaxseed oil 170-204
<br>Chia oil 190-199

<br><br>If using any oil above a 100, I'd advise to keep the purchase and usage quantities lower.
 It's smart to add antioxidants like tocopherol, rosemary oleoresin, or similar.
<br><br>Anything over 125 I'd consider combining a few strategies. They should be added to cool-down phases in formulas with antioxidants. Products could bottled in airless pumps. Alternatively, I’ve been using some oils like that as part of a very quickly used up product. Don’t mix these oils with clay: traces of metals will make them rancid quickly (from my experience: an emulsifying clay mask with grapeseed oil went rancid within a month or two). 
<br><br>As for the group over 150… Not for formulation in my books, rather for oil painting. (The beauty industry might not agree though on these points). 
<br><br><b>Comedogenic ratings</b>
<br><br>Another factor I'm sure you've heard about is comedogenicity of oils, i.e. how likely they are to clog the pores. 
<br><br> The basis of this rating system is debated a lot, since the initial studies were conducted by slathering raw ingredients on the ear of a rabbit (for example, Fulton et al., <em>Non-comedogenic cosmetics</em>, 1976). 
How relevant will that be for humans? Will a product, containing only some comedogenic ingredients, have a negative effect? After animal studies, some human studies were conducted (for instance, 1982 study by Mills and Klingman), 
but the results did not exactly match the earlier ones. In 1989, the American Academy of Dermatology decided that products containing ingredients that exhibit mid-to-severe comedogenicity on rabbits should be tested on humans; otherwise it should not be an issue. 
The comedogenic rating system was reevaluated rather recently, in 2006, by Draelos and DiNardo in <a href="http://www.beauty-review.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A-re-evaluation-of-the-comedogenicity-concept.pdf"><em>A re-evaluation of the comedogenicity concept</em></a>. 
This study was conducted on humans, using products rather than ingredients. 
Their conclusion was that "Finished products using comedogenic ingredients are not necessarily comedogenic". 
Products containing at least two supposedly comedogenic ingredients were compared to the baseline effects of octyl palmitate and acetylated lanolin alcohol (both of which are comedogenic undiliuted). 
It seems as though none of the products containing small amounts of cocoa butter, beeswax, stearic acid, isopropyl myristate, etc showed sufficient comedogenic activity.
<br><br>So how could a formulator interpret all this information? 
The widely available rating data seems to supplied by the early rabbit studies. The way I see it is that since it's about undiluted materials, 
I'm not going to worry about low ratings (0-2) at all. As for the higher end (3-5), I'll restrict their use, more so in facial leave-on products like facial oils and creams. I have felt the wrath of undiluted coconut oil on the face before (but I know some people who tolerate it well too). 
Looking at Draelos and DiNardo study, you'll notice that tested products contained up to 5% of a "problem" ingredient without causing actual problems. 
Seems like a reasonable amount, maximum 5%. A lot of the times oils are layered anyway, it's uncommon to see just a single oil in the oil-phase of an emulsion. If you have more acne-prone skin, you might want to avoid these completely.
<br><br>Here's a list of a few higher-rated oils:  
       
<br><br>Cocoa butter – 4
<br>Coconut oil – 4 
<br>Corn oil – 3
<br>Cottonseed oil – 3
<br>Cupuacu butter – 4
<br>Soybean oil – 3
<br>Wheat germ oil – 5

<br><br>You can easily look up any oil for this rating. Some oil will not only be comedogenic, but also prone to rancidity (like soybean), therefore easy to eliminate from your options.
<br><br><b>A word against hard oils</b>

<br><br><img src="/img/postimg/coconut_oil1.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='/img/default.jpg'" style="width:80%" alt="Coconut oil">

<br><br>While the hard oils and butters have a great iodine value, I have stopped using some of them in more solid oil-based formulas like lip balms, salves, hair conditioner bars. 
<br><br>The problem is the borderline melting temperature (25-30&#176;C) that does not fair well between seasonal changes. Lip balms and  salves I've made in winters would start “sweating” in  the summer and afterwards get a whitish crystallized appearance and less-than-pleasant texture while resolidifying slowly. For instance, 20% coconut in lip balms has caused very noticeable changes. You can get that unpleasant appearance with a variety of hard oils even right after making if the product cools too slowly. The usual advice when dealing with butters is to let them cool down quickly in the fridge. From my experience, shea butter seems to be excessively prone to graininess, so it’s been demoted to emulsions on my end.
<br><br>That's why you won't find the shea, coconut, babassu oils in my lip balms anymore. Melting on skin contact in a great feature, melting on your shelf and solidifying again – not so much. So I am sticking to oils that won’t melt in the Northern summer, like cocoa (34&#176;C), kokum (32-40&#176;C), illipe (34-38&#176;C) butters. If you want to include softer oils in such formulas, I recommend using smaller amounts, like below 10%.
<br><br>So, when choosing your oils, you might want to consider their consistency, iodine value, and comedogenic rating. Nothing is written in stone, however, you'll find a lot of companies making their own rules.
<br><br>This article might be expanded in the future. The next part will cover other oil-phase ingredients besides vegetable oils.</p>
