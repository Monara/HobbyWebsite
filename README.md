# HobbyWebsite
Hobby-related website/blog made with back-to-basics tech stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL). 

This website contains such features as a slideshow gallery, a custom calculation widget, comment sections, a DuckDuckGo search, and a contact form. The contact form as well as comments under each post are submitted after completing an hCaptcha challenge. The administrator section is used to submit posts, review and delete comments. This project uses images from Unsplash, Pixabay, Pexels. Made from scratch, my own design and content.
